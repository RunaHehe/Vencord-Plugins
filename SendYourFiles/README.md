# SendYourFile
A Vencord/Equicord plugin that allows you to send your files above 10mb to BuzzHeavier, Catbox, Litterbox! (Inspired by [shipwr3ckd](https://github.com/shipwr3ckd/revengeplugin/tree/gh-pages/catbox.mo))

## Features
- Uploads your files to 1 of 3 hosts
- No file size limit (Only on BuzzHeavier)
- Bypasses Discord's 10mb upload completely by sending the uploaded content to the selected provider

#

> [!NOTE]
> Guidelines applies to the file provider you use. We are not responsible if you were IP banned from the file provider. We are not affiliated from BuzzHeavier, Catbox and Litterbox. We just use their service because we think it's cool to have it built in discord and also they're cool.

If you're a BuzzHeavier, Catbox (and Litterbox) developer and you want us to remove your service off of our plugins, please contact us in discord.
